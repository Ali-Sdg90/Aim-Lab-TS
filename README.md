<h2>Development Journey</h2>
<p>
    This project serves as a testament to the developer's commitment to
    mastering TypeScript. The development process spanned a month, and I
    recorded almost every second of its development. In the end, I had 36 hours
    of footage, which I then compressed into a 2-minute time-lapse, allowing you
    to witness how the project came to life. This time-lapse is available on
    <a target="_new" href="https://youtu.be/GUWZojIEkEg">YouTube</a>.
